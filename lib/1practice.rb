#Practice 1:
# def reverse(string)
#   string.reverse
# end

# def reverse_2(string)
#   reversed =  []
#   string.split("").each {|char| reversed.unshift(char)}
#   reversed.join
# end
# p reverse_2("I will REverse THIS sting!")


#alternative method thoughts
# def reverse_2(string)
#   split_string = string.split("")
#   reversed =  []
#   split_string.each {|char| reversed.unshift(char)}
#   reversed_string = reversed.join
# end
# p reverse_2("I will REverse THIS sting!")

# ---------------- 
# Practice 2:

# prices = ["$2.50", 
#           "32.25$",
#           "3$.25",
#           "9.$50",
#           "75.98"]
# refactored = []

#  refactored = prices.map do |price|
#     price.delete! "$"
#     "$%05.2f" % price
#   end


#Sentence Array: Write a method that adds each word of a sentence to an array. 
#Then, capitalize every other word in the sentence. Return the new sentence.

#- Example:
    
 #   "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." ["The", "quick", "brown" â€¦]
    
  #  => "The quick Brown fox Jumps over The lazy Dog."
   
# - Extensions:
#     - Use a sentence with other capital letters in it. The method should still capitalize every alternate word, regardless of other capitalization.
#     - Use a sentence with special characters, spaces, etc. Does your method still work?
#     - Refactor your solution to keep your main method under 5 lines. Use helper methods.
#     - Write a test suite to prove that your solution works.

def capitalize_every_other_word
  sentence_array = sentence.split(' ')

  end
  transformed = sentence_array.join(" ")

#perhaps try with index(0) or index.even? if index % 2 == 0, word.upcase, end

# def capitalize_words(string)
#  sentence.split.map(&:capitalize).join(' ')
